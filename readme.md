# Git Test File
After installing Git, I am checking to see if everything is working properly. I have listed all the steps below.

1.) created a test repository 

2.) git init while I am inside the folder through command prompt

3.) opened folder in VSCode

4.) created a markdown file called readme.md

5.) command prompt: git add readme.md 

        -> I have added the readme.md file into the staging area
        
        + every milestone I hit in my project I should run this command

6.) command prompt: git status

        -> Shows all the files that I have added to the staging area

7.) command prompt: git commit -m "_______"

        -> committing all changes to the github database or cloud
